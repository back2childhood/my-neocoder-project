# A online programmer forum
## brief introduction
I want to build a forum that every programmer can share their knowledge and technologies.

In this forum, you can not only write blogs, but also you can read others' blogs and like them, share them, comment them. Even you can send private message to someone else.
## how to use it
```
// pull the code to your computer
https://github.com/back2childhood/online-pragrammer-forum.git
// open the code with idea and run it
// open the browser and enter 
http://www.localhost:8080/myCommunity/index
// now, you can see the homepage of this project
```
## core functions and technologies
